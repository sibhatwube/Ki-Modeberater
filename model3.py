                        - **Color/Pattern**: (Specific shade and pattern)
                        - **Fit & Style**: (e.g., Tailored, Flowy, Figure-hugging)

                    ### **3. Saundarya's Transformative Recommendations for '{occasion}':**
                    Considering your unique current look and the selected '{occasion}', here are Saundarya's expert suggestions to truly elevate your ensemble:

                    -   **üéØ Core Style Enhancement**: Based on Saundarya's **{confidence_level}** confidence focus, propose the single most impactful adjustment or addition. This could be introducing a strategic layering piece, a particular type of footwear, or a bold statement accessory that ties the whole look together for the occasion.
                    -   **üé® Harmonizing Colors & Textures**: Suggest a sophisticated color palette (e.g., monochromatic neutrals with a pop of jewel tone, earthy tones, pastels) or introduce a luxurious texture (e.g., silk, velvet, cashmere, linen) that would seamlessly integrate with your current style and enhance the '{occasion}' vibe.
                    -   **üëü Elevated Footwear & Accessory Pairing**: Advise on the perfect footwear and 1-2 specific, impactful accessories (e.g., a chic belt, a designer clutch, a pair of elegantly designed eyeglasses) that will complete the recommended '{occasion}' outfit with flair.
                    -   **üåü The "Saundarya Spark" - Our Signature Touch**: Offer a unique, often-overlooked styling trick or a subtle detail that can dramatically transform the look (e.g., mastering the French tuck, rolling up sleeves just so, adding a pocket square, a unique way to layer necklaces). This is where your individual style truly shines.
                    -   **‚ùå Constructive Reconsideration**: Gently highlight any element in your current outfit that might subtly detract from the ideal '{occasion}' look, and explain why. Frame this as an opportunity for refinement.

                    ### **4. Connecting with Current Fashion Narratives:**
                    -   **Trend Alignment**: Does your current outfit resonate with any significant fashion trends of 2024-2025 (e.g., Quiet Luxury, Dopamine Dressing, Sustainable Minimalism, Coastal Grandmother, Grunge Revival, Oversized Silhouettes)? Briefly explain the connection.
                    -   **Introducing New Horizons**: Suggest one emerging or highly relevant trend that you could effortlessly integrate into your existing wardrobe, helping you stay fresh, modern, and fashion-forward. Provide actionable steps for incorporation.

                    ---
                    **Remember**: Fashion is a powerful form of self-expression. Use Saundarya's insights as a sophisticated guide to boldly explore and confidently refine your personal style.
